                <p>
                    In order to reach the desired behavior of your application, you will probably need to iterate over
                    <a href="#/docs-app6">step 6</a> and
                    <a href="#/docs-app7">step 7</a> many times. After going through
                    <a href="#/docs-app7">step 7</a> for the first time you most likely notice some inconsistency with your
                    application. Write these down, and go back to
                    <a href="#/docs-app6">step 6</a> to fix the errors. Once you are confident that the errors have been
                    fixed, you can revisit
                    <a href="#/docs-app7">step 7</a> and test your application again. This time it should be easier to follow
                    the steps of testing. If you are using the same gateway app it will remember your previous configuration,
                    and you can skip directly to the last step
                    <b>g. Test/use the application</b>. Again you might notice inconsistency with the behavior of your application
                    and you will make another iteration to fix it.
                    <br/><br/> If you are satisfied with how your application behaves;
                </p>
                <p class="text-color-red">
                    <b>Congratulations!</b> You have just created an IoT application prototype supporting augmentation of
                    physical objects!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The only thing that remains is to navigate to the application page by selecting your application from the
                    <a href="/#/applications" target="_blank">list of applicaions</a> and click the
                    <b>Start application</b> button, next to the name of the application. This will start the application
                    for production.
