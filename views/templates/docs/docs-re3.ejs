                <h2>3. Map FEEDBACK cards to TILE rules</h2>
                <p>
                    In the <a href="{{prevUrl">previous section</a> you started creating a TILE rule by defining the input
                    <b>HUMAN ACTION</b>. In this section you will be mapping the <b>FEEDBACK</b> to the second part of the
                    TILE rule form, seen in the image below.
                </p>
                <div class="docs-img opacity75">
                    <img src="/images/howto/howto-tile-rule-form-with-explanation.png" alt="tile_rule_form_with_explanation" />
                    <br/>
                    <span>TILE rule form divided into HUMAN ACTIONS and FEEDBACK</span>
                </div>
                <hr/>
                <p>
                    In the <b>FEEDBACK</b> section of the TILE rule form, select the desired feedback in the dropboxes before
                    the
                    <b>ON</b> keyword, and select the target TILES Square from the last dropdown box. By clicking
                    <b>Create</b> the rule will be stored in the list as seen below. This specific rule will define that:<br/><br/>
                    <i>IF the <b>front_door</b> TILES Square is <b>Single tapped</b> THEN the <b>garage_door</b> TILES Square will turn <b>LED ON Pink</b></i>
                </p>
