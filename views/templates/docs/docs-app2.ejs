                <p>
                    In this step of the <i>TILES toolkit Application Development Process</i> you will be creating
                    a user account in the TILES Cloud web portal. If you have already created an account, you can skip to
                    the
                    <a href="{{nextUrl()}}">next step</a>.
                </p>
                <h3>Creating a user account</h3>
                <p>
                    To create a user account, navigate to the <a href="/#/users">Users page</a>, and enter a username in
                    the form and click <b>Post</b> as seen in the image below.
                </p>
                <div class="docs-img opacity75">
                    <img src="/images/howto/howto-create-user.png" alt="create_user" />

                    <span>Creating a new user account</span>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Once you have created a new user it will appear in the list. If you click on your username, you will be able to see a list
                    of all your connected TILES Squares. If you just created a new account, this list will be empty, so don't
                    worry if you can't see your TILES there yet.
