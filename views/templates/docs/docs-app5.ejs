                <p>
                    In the <a href="{{prevUrl()}}">previous step</a> you configured your application with the digital placeholders
                    for the physical objects you will use in your application. Now you are ready to start code your application,
                    but before you can do that, you need to start the development environment in which you will be writing
                    the application code. In this section we will show how to start the
                    <b>Cloud Development Environment</b>. Please visit the
                    <a href="{{selectDevEnvUrl}}">development environment</a> section for more information on other available
                    development environments.
                </p>
                <h3>Starting Cloud Development Environment</h3>
                <p>
                    To start the Cloud Development Environment, there is only one thing you need to do. Go to the application details by selecting
                    your application from the
                    <a href="/#/applications" target="_blank">list of applications</a>. Here you should see a button with
                    the text
                    <b>Start hosting</b>. Please click this button, and your Cloud Development Environment will be started.
                    After clicking the button, a second button will appear with the text
                    <b>Launch Environment</b>. Click this button, and the Cloud Development Environment will be openedgatew in
                    a new tab in your browser. The environment should resemble the image seen below.
