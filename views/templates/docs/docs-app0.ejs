                <h2>TILES toolkit Application Development Process</h2>

                <p>
                    If you are looking for a way to rapidly develop and prototype your IoT application ideas based on everyday object augmentation,
                    you should keep on reading this section about the
                    <i>TILES toolkit Application Development Process</i> (TADP). The TADP is a process intended to guide IoT
                    application developers through the required steps of prototyping a fully functional IoT application using
                    the TILES toolkit. Whether you are a non-expert or an expert user, this section will enable you to rapidly
                    transform your IoT application ideas into working prototypes with hardware components, message events
                    and running program code in no time.

                    <br/><br/> An illustration of the TADP and a short description of the defined steps can be seen below.
                    Go through each subsection of the documentation sequentially and you will have a working prototype of
                    your IoT application operable in just a few moments. Developing IoT applications have never been easier!
