                <h2>1. Introduction to the Rule Engine API</h2>
                <p>
                    If you are developing your application using the Rule Engine
                    <a href="{{selectDevEnvUrl}}">Development Environment</a>, this chapter will explain how you can use
                    the Rule Engine API to develop your application. This chapter will guide you through the steps of transitioning
                    from your TILES Cards ideation into a working prototype of your application. The steps of this processs
                    are listed below.
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>Map HUMAN ACTIONS cards with TILES API events</li>
                        <li>Map FEEDBACK cards with TILES API commands</li>
                        <li>Map SERVICES cards with TILES API sources</li>
                    </ol>
                    After you have finished this Rule Engine API chapter, you should continue with the
                    <a href="#/docs-app7">Test Application</a> step of the <i>Application Development Process</i> to test
                    your application.
                </p>
                <h3>The Rule Engine Development Environment</h3>
                <p>
                    When you have created an application to use the Rule Engine Development Environment, you can navigate to the environment
                    by selecting your application from the
                    <a href="/#/applications" target="_blank">list of applications</a>. Your application should look similar
                    to the
                    <b>garage_control_system</b> seen below.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At this point, you should have defined the items you want to use in your application by going through the steps of the
                    <a href="#/docs-app4">List Physical Objects</a> step of the
                    <i>Application Development Process</i>.
                </p>
