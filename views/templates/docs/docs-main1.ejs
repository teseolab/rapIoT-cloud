                <p>
                    This documentation section will show you how to use the TILES toolkit to make interactive objects for learning and play.
                    It will guide you through everything from the moment you acquire your first TILES hardware device, to
                    the moment you are ready to launch your IoT application and ship it as a product. For more information,
                    please visit the <a href="{{tilestoolkitUrl}}">TILES toolkit homepage</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This Guide is broken down into <i>five</i> parts:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <a href="{{getStartedUrl}}">Getting Started</a> goes over the basics of what you need for development
                            and how the TILES toolkit works. If you are not an expert, and you have never played with embedded
                            hardware devices or programmed your own application, this is the section for you. If you are
                            an expert user and eager to get started with development, you can skip this section to get your
                            hands dirty right away. You will always be able to revisit this section later.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="{{devProcessUrl}}">Application Development Process</a> explains the development process
                            that will guide you as a developer in turning your application ideas into working prototypes
                            ready to be used by end users. Whether you are new to programming and want to create your first
                            IoT application, or you are an experienced programmer that want to use the TILES toolkit in your
                            latest project, this is the section for you.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="{{JSdevUrl}}">JavaScript API</a> supplements the
                            <b>5. Code Application</b> phase of the Application Development Process. This is intended for
                            you if you choose to use JavaScript for developing your TILES application. This section also
                            contains code samples for JavaScript.
                        </li>

                            <a href="{{extProcessUrl}}">TILES toolkit Extension Process</a> details the process of extending
                            the TILES toolkit with new features to be used in your own projects. This section is intended
                            for the experienced user that wants to extend the TILES toolkit with new features such as new
                            hardware capabilities for the TILES Squares, or new API features for the development environments.
                        </li>

                            <b>5. Code Application</b> phase of the Application Development Process. This is intended for
                            you if you choose to use Rule Engine for developing your TILES application. This section also
                            contains samples for Rule Engine applications.

                    The best way to use this guide depends on your goal. If you are a <i>non-expert</i> intending to develop
                    your first IoT application, you should:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Go through <a href="{{getStartedUrl}}">Getting Started</a></li>
                        <li>Go through the <a href="{{devProcessUrl}}">Application Development Process</a></li>
                        <li>Use <a href="{{JSdevUrl}}">JavaScript API</a> for development</li>
                    </ol>
                    If you are an expert user intending to extend the toolkit you should:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Get familiar with <a href="{{getStartedUrl}}">Getting Started</a></li>
                        <li>Go through the <a href="{{extProcessUrl}}">TILES toolkit Extension Process</a></li>
