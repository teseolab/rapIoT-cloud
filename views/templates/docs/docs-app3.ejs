                <h2>3. Create and configure application</h2>
                <p>
                    This step of the process involves defining an application name and create the application context by selecting a development
                    environment in the TILES Cloud web portal. Which development environment you select depends on how you
                    want to develop your application. See the
                    <a href="{{selectDevEnvUrl}}" target="_blank">development environment</a> section to read more about the available environments.
                    If this is the first time you use the TILES toolkit for your IoT application prototyping, we suggest
                    you select the
                    <b>Cloud development environment</b> as this is what we will be using throughout this tutorial.
                </p>
                <h3>Creating a new application in TILES Cloud</h3>
                <p>
                    To create a new application, navigate to the <a href="/#/applications" target="_blank">applications</a> page of the TILES
                    Cloud web portal. Here you will be able to see all registered applications together with some information
                    about them, as seen in the image below.
                </p>
                <div class="docs-img opacity75">
                    <img src="/images/howto/howto-list-applications.png" alt="list_applications" />
                    <br/>
                    <span>List of Applications in TILES Cloud web portal</span>
                </div>
                <p>
                    By clicking the <b>Create new application</b> you will be prompted with the create application form,
                    as seen below. Here you will enter a name for your application, select the development environment, and
                    select the owner of the application. If you are unsure of which development environmnet to use, we suggest
                    the
                    <b>Cloud development environment</b>. As application owner, please select your username, as you defined
                    in the <a href="{{prevUrl()}}">previous step</a>. After filling the form, hit the <b>Create</b> button,
                    and your application will appear in the list of applications.
                </p>
