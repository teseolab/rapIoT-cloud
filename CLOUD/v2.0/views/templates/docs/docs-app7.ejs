                <h2>7. Test application</h2>
                <p>
                    If you have reached this step of the process you are ready to test your application. You should now have followed all six
                    previous steps of the application development process, including going through the
                    <a href="{{JSdevUrl}}">JavaScript API</a> section for instructions on how to code your application. Please
                    go through the following steps to test your application.
                </p>
                <h3>a. Run application in test mode</h3>
                <p class="text-signal-orange">
                    <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-warning-sign"></span> This step is intended for
                    <b>Cloud Development Environment</b> only!
                </p>
                <p>
                    To run your application in test mode using the Cloud Development Environment follow these steps:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Open the Cloud Development Environment as seen on the image below
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Select the <b>tiles.js</b> template file by double clicking on it in the list to the left
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Locate and click the
                            <img src="/images/howto/howto-cloud9-ide-run.png" alt="run_cloud9_ide" /> button
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Notice the output text in the
                            <b>bash</b> section in the bottom of the window.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <div class="docs-img opacity75">
                    <img src="/images/howto/howto-cloud9-ide.png" alt="cloud9_ide" />
                    <br/>
                    <span>Cloud Development Environment</span>
                </div>

                <h3>b. Procure and ready TILES Squares</h3>
                <p>
                    For each of the items you configured in your application in
                    <a href="#/docs-app4">step 4</a> of the process, you should procure one physical TILES Square. Every
                    item will soon be paired with the physical squares in your application.
                </p>
                <h3>c. Procure and ready physical objects</h3>
                <p>
                    Similarly, for each physical TILES Square you need the physical object on which you will attach the TILES Square devices.
                    You should now procure all the physical objects that will be used in your application. The TILES Squares
                    will detect the HUMAN ACTIONS you perform on the objects, and pass the information as events into the
                    application code you have just written.
                </p>

                <h3>d. Open TILES Gateway app and log in</h3>
                <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Open up the TILES Gateway</li>
                        <li>Enter your <b>username</b></li>
                        <li>Enter the <b>host address</b> to the TILES Cloud server</li>
                        <li>Enter the <b>port number</b> (should be 8080)</li>
                        <li>Click <b>Log in!</b></li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <div class="docs-img docs-app">
                    <img src="/images/howto/howto-gateway-login.png" alt="gateway_login" \>
                    <br/>
                    <span>Log into app with server address, username and port number</span>
                </div>

                <h3>e. Select the application</h3>
                <p>
                    Select your application from the list of applications by clicking <b>VIEW APP</b>
                </p>
                <div class="docs-img docs-app">
                    <img src="/images/howto/howto-gateway-select-app.png" alt="gateway_select_app" />
                    <br/>
                    <span>List of available applications in gateway</span>
                </div>

                <h3>f. Pair TILES Squares with items</h3>
                <p>
                    After you have selected your application, you should see a list of all the items you have defined for your application.
                    In the image below we can see that we have selected the
                    <b>garage_control_system</b> that has three items defined:
                    <b>garage_door</b>,
                    <b>front_door</b> and
                    <b>car</b>.
                </p>
                <div class="docs-img docs-app">
                    <img src="/images/howto/howto-gateway-list-vt-in-app.png" alt="gateway_list_virtualTiles_in_app" />
                    <br/>
                    <span>List of items in application</span>
                </div>
                <p>
                    For each of the items, click the <b>PAIR</b> button, and select an available physical TILES Square. The
                    item should now move from the list <b>UNPAIRED TILES</b> to the list
                    <b>PAIRED TILES</b>, and you have successfully paired the item and physical TILES Square. Last, but not
                    least, you should attach the physical TILES Square to the physical objects.
                </p>

                <h3>g. Test/use the application</h3>
                <p>
                    Now you should be able to use the application by interacting with the physical objects that you have attached the TILES Squares
                    to. In addition, you will be able to get more debug information by looking at the
                    <b>bash</b> section, described in step "a" above.
