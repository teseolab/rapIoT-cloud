                <p>
                    The architecture of the TILES toolkit is divided into three layers as seen on the figure above. Below is a short description
                    of the responsibilities of each layer of the TILES toolkit.
                </p>
                <h3>TILES Squares</h3>
                <p>The TILES Squares are the embedded hardware devices of the TILES toolkit, implemented as the immediate layer
                    for end user interaction. Users of any TILES application will tap, tilt and otherwise interact with the TILES
                    Squares to produce events that will be sent to the TILES Gateway, which will forward the events to the
                    TILES Cloud server for processing. TILES Squares features several
                    <a href="#/docs-main5">data primitives</a> for input and output interaction with the TILES toolkit.
                </p>
                <h3>TILES Gateway</h3>
                <p>
                    The TILES Gateway is responsible for forwarding the events between the TILES Squares and the TILES Cloud. The Gateway will
                    communicate with the squares through Bluetooth, while the communication with the server is performed
                    over the Internet. The TILES Gateway runs on any regular internet enabled smartphone with Bluetooth support.
                    This makes it easy to carry around as you interact with your TILES Squares.
                </p>
                <h3>TILES Cloud</h3>
                <p>
                    The TILES Cloud is the brains behind the TILES toolkit. This is where the application logic will run, and where the program
                    code is executed. The TILES Cloud will receive TILES Square input events from the connected Gateways,
                    and will process the events and reply to the Gateway with output commands that will set the output primitives
                    of the TILES Squares. The TILES Cloud also features interfaces for connecting your TILES application
                    to available web services, which enables your TILES application to be integrated into your everyday life.
