                <h2>TILES toolkit Extension Process</h2>

                <p>
                    If you are looking for a way to customize the TILES toolkit by adding additional hardware features in the
                    <b>TILES Squares</b> or if you want to extend the
                    <b>development APIs</b> of the toolkit, then the <i>TILES toolkit Excension Process</i> (TEP) is indeded
                    for you. The TEP is a process intended to guide <i>expert users</i> through the steps of extending the
                    TILES toolkit with new and improved hardware and software capabilities. Following the steps of the TEP
                    should enable you to take the existing TILES toolkit, and customize it to fit your needs. Employing the
                    TEP systematically imply that the new features of the toolkit will be available to
                    <i>non-expert users</i> in IoT application development.

                    <br/><br/> An illustration of the TEP and a short description of the defined steps can be seen below.
                    Go through each subsection of the documentation sequentially and you will end up with an extended TILES
                    toolkit in just a few moments.
