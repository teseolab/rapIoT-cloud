                <h2>2. Map HUMAN ACTIONS cards to TILE rules</h2>
                <p>
                    To define rules for HUMAN ACTIONS cards, you need to find the TILE rule section in your Rule Engine Development Environment,
                    seen in the image below.
                </p>
                <div class="docs-img opacity75">
                    <img src="/images/howto/howto-add-tile-rule.png" alt="add_new_tile_rule" />
                    <br/>
                    <span>Add new TILE rule</span>
                </div>
                <hr/>
                <p>
                    Click the
                    <img src="/images/howto/howto-new-tile-rule-button.png" alt="+ new TILE rule" /> button to open the TILE
                    rule form seen below.
                </p>
                <div class="docs-img opacity75">
                    <img src="/images/howto/howto-tile-rule-form.png" alt="tile_rule_form" />
                    <br/>
                    <span>TILE rule form</span>
                </div>
                <hr/>
                <p>
                    In the TILE rule form, the left part is related to the
                    <b>HUMAN ACTIONS</b> cards, while the right part is related to the
                    <b>FEEDBACK</b> cards, as seen in the image below.
                </p>
                <div class="docs-img opacity75">
                    <img src="/images/howto/howto-tile-rule-form-with-explanation.png" alt="tile_rule_form_with_explanation" />
                    <br/>
                    <span>TILE rule form divided into HUMAN ACTIONS and FEEDBACK</span>
                </div>
                <hr/>
                <p>
                    In the <b>HUMAN ACTIONS</b> section of the TILE rule form, select the relevant input TILES Square from
                    the first dropdown box, and select the trigger action in the second. To conclude the TILE rule, you also
                    need to define a <b>FEEDBACK</b> action. To see how to define the <b>FEEDBACK</b> actions, see the
                    <a href="{{nextUrl}}">next section</a>.
